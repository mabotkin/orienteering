# Orienteering Round Generator
This is a program to generate an Orienteering Round.  The program should output a series of room assignments for easy setup of the paths of each team.  The program also outputs a direction for each team to map its answer to the next room number (very basic mapping, only uses four basic operations).  Designed for TJIMO 2016.
